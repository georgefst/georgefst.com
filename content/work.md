# Consulting

currently available for contracting work - drop me a line

my major interest is in making (functional) programming easier
designing languages
improving UX of programming tools
taking part in discussions around community direction

don't judge too harshly on this site!
it's a work in progress, plus I'm a developer not a designer
and yes, I'm bringing back sidebars back in to fashion - it's responsive so it's cool
