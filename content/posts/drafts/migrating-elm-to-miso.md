# Elm is dead, long live Elm

EDIT: alternative angle, or maybe just a separate post:
focus on my personal DevX contributions, i.e. Jsaddle-warp for Miso Wasm and Miso "HMR" (admittedly both are unmerged)
also, potentially IHP Miso Wasm example
see discussion on Discord with Liam 04/02/2025

Miso is TEA, and it's better

no secret that many in the Haskell community have major frustrations with Elm
think it was Sandy who went on a massive rant
Chris Done called it a dead end?

this could be quite a good way to sell my consulting services...
